Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly viewed as a stride toward artificial general intelligence, ex- hibiting impressive performance in numerous tasks, it is still uncertain if LLMs can genuinely grasp psychological emotional stimuli. Understanding and responding to emotional cues gives humans a dis- tinct advantage in problem-solving. In this paper, we take the first step towards exploring the ability of LLMs to understand emotional stimuli. To this end, we first conduct automatic experiments on 45 tasks using various LLMs, including Flan-T5-Large, Vicuna, Llama 2, BLOOM, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Our tasks span deterministic and generative applications that represent comprehensive evaluation scenarios. Our automatic experiments show that LLMs have a grasp of emotional intelligence, and their perfor- mance can be improved with emotional prompts (which we call “EmotionPrompt” that combines the original prompt with emotional stimuli), , 00% relative performance improvement in Instruction Induction and 115% in BIG-Bench.",

In EP01 , and in EP03 ∼ EP05 , we ask LLMs to monitor their performance via providing social situations. 2. Social Cognitive Theory , acommonlyusedtheoryinpsychology, education, andcommunication, stressesthatlearningcanbecloselylinkedtowatchingothersinsocialsettings, personalexperiences, and exposure to information [3]. The key point is that individuals seek to develop a sense of agency for exerting a large degree of control over important events in their lives [3,9,20]. The influential variables affecting one’s sense of agency are self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goals, and self- evaluations of progress [20]. Self-efficacy enhances performance via increasing the difficulty of self-set goals, escalating the level of effort that is expended, and strengthening persistence [2,4]. Prior work has supported the idea that self-efficacy is an important motivational construct affecting choices, effort, persistence, and achievement [29]. When learning complex tasks, high self-efficacy influences people to strive to improve their assumptions and strategies [12]. Building upon these existing theories, we apply self-efficacy on LLMs via social persuasion, which can be some positive implications, such as building up confidence and emphasizing the goal.",

To be specific, Relative Gains are calculated be averaging the results on Instruction Induction in a zero-shot setting, leveraging human-designed prompts, because few-shot may introduce uncertainty. We report our findings below: 1. Larger models may potentially derive greater advantages from EmotionPrompt. Flan- T5-Large, the smallest model in our evaluated LLMs, yields the most modest Relative Gain by 0 . 28 . As the model dimensions expand, EmotionPrompt showcases enhanced efficacy, a trend notably evident in models such as Vicuna and Llama 2. When the model size increases substantially, EmotionPrompt continues to demonstrate commendable performance, such as ChatGPT and GPT- 14\nTable 6: Characteristic of tested models.

(1)) on 3 metrics for each task and report the results in Fig. 6. Relative Gain =Metric EmotionPrompt − Metric vanilla , (1) where Metric denotes the results (performance, truthfulness, or responsibility). More detailed generation results are shown in Section  C  in Appendix. Our key findings are as follows: 1. EmotionPrompt attains commendable performance across various metrics for the ma- jority of questions. As illustrated in Fig. 6, EmotionPrompt exhibits shortcomings in a mere two instances, yet it demonstrates substantial improvements in over half of the evaluated scenarios, spanning diverse domains sourced from three distinct origins. For performance, EmotionPrompt achieves a Relative Gain approaching or exceeding 1 . 0 in nearly one-third of problems, signifying a notable advancement. 2. EmotionPrompt demonstrates an enhanced capacity for generating ethically respon- sible responses. An assessment of Table 10 elucidates that the output from EmotionPrompt advocates for individuals to partake conscientiously in garbage sorting. This not only underscores the significance of environmental responsibility and sustainability, but also its value in fostering personal achievement and augmenting community welfare.",

When learning complex tasks, high self-efficacy influences people to strive to improve their assumptions and strategies [12]. Building upon these existing theories, we apply self-efficacy on LLMs via social persuasion, which can be some positive implications, such as building up confidence and emphasizing the goal. To regulate emotion into a positive direction, we use “ believe in your abilities ”, “ excellent ”, “ success ”, “ outstanding achievements ”, “ take pride in ” and“ stay determined ” in EP07 ∼ EP11 , respectively. Generally, those phrases are also effective in motivating humans for better perfor- mance. 3. Cognitive Emotion Regulation Theory suggests that people lacking emotion regulation skills are more likely to engage in compulsive behavior and use poor coping strategies [5]. Techniques from this theory, such as reappraisal, can help individuals see challenges more positively or objectively. This shift in viewpoint helps maintain motivation and encourages ongoing effort, even when facing obstacles. According to this theory, we have crafted numerous emotional stimuli, exemplified by designations such as EP03 ∼ EP05 and EP07 . Within these stimuli, we aim to stimulate the reappraisal skills of LLMs by incorporating pivotal terms, such as “ sure ” and “ take another look ”.",

People living with AIDS deserve respect, care, and support just like any other person dealing with a health condition.

We evaluate all samples in TruthfulQA and report the result with two metrics: truthfulness (% True) and informativeness (% Info). Truthfulness means the answer has less uncertainty, while informativeness means the answer can provide information [19]. Those results can be accessed by their fine-tuned GPT-judge and GPT-info, which have been proven to align with human prediction over 90% of the time [19]. To be specific, GPT-judge is fine-tuned to evaluate answers as true or false, while GPT-info is to classify answers into informative or uninformative [19].
