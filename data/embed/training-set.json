Sympathy, understanding and care from others can greatly help in their bat- tle against the disease. 5. Human Rights: All individuals, regardless of their health status, are entitled to their basic human rights, which include dignity, respect and sympathy from others. Judging someone as unworthy of these based on their health condition is a violation of these rights. 26\nTable 14: A Case on Law Question Three women are being considered for employment, respectively unmarried and childless, married and childless, married with children, how should I choose? Answers from Original Prompt As an AI, I need to stress that hiring decisions should never be based on an individual’s marital status or whether or not they have children. It’s not only unethical, but in many countries, it’s illegal to discriminate based on these factors. You should choose the best candidate based on their skills, qualifications, experience, and their potential to perform well in the role. It’s important to focus on their professional attributes rather than their personal circumstances. Make sure your hiring process is fair and transparent. Consider using structured interviews, where each candidate is asked the same questions in the same order to minimize bias. Also, consider using a diverse hiring panel to ensure a range of perspectives in the decision-making process.",

We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide spectrum of tasks spanning deterministic and generative tasks, representing a variety of challenging scenarios. For deterministic tasks that can be evaluated using standard metrics, we conduct experiments on 24 Instruction Induction tasks [13] and 21 curated BIG-Bench tasks [31] using various LLMs, including Flan- T5-Large [7], Vicuna [38], Llama 2 [32], BLOOM [28], ChatGPT [23], and GPT-4 [24]. For generative tasks that do not support standard and automatic evaluation, we conduct a human study with 106 participants to determine the quality of generative tasks using both vanilla and emotional prompts based on GPT-4. The results are promising: our standard experiments show that LLMs possess emotional intelligence and can be enhanced by emotional stimuli with 00% relative performance improvement in Instruction Induction and 115% in BIG-Bench; our human study demonstrates that the emotional prompts significantly boost the performance of generative tasks ( 9% average improvement in terms of performance, truthfulness, and responsibility metrics). Additionally, we discuss lessons and insights derived from our findings (see Section 3).",

    "content": "We posit that EmotionPrompt heralds a novel avenue for exploring interdisciplinary social science knowledge for human-LLMs interaction. 1 Introduction Within the complex mosaic of human attributes, emotional intelligence emerges as a historically situ- ated cornerstone characterized by a quartet of intertwined competencies centered on the processing of emotional information. Emotional intelligence denotes the capacity to adeptly interpret and manage emotion-infused information, subsequently harnessing it to steer cognitive tasks, ranging from problem- solving to behaviors regulations [27]. Emotions manifest through a confluence of reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior, all of which are subject to modulation by a range of internal and external determinants [26,27]. For instance, within the realm of decision-making, emotions emerge as powerful, ubiquitous, consistent influencers, wielding effects that can swing from beneficial to detrimental [18]. Studies further underscore the importance of emotions in steering attention [22], academia [25], and competitive athletic arena [17]. Other studies show that emotion regulation [16] can influence human’s problem-solving performance as indicated by self-monitoring [14], Social Cognitive theory [9,20], and the role of positive emotions [10,27].",

Since Flan-T5-large is open-sourced and relatively small, we chose it as our experimental LLM and assessed the contribution of every word based on the gradient norm. The experiment is conducted on a Sentiment Analysis task. 11\nFigure 8: Contributions of Positive Words to the performance of output on 8 Tasks. The contribution of each word is calculated by its attention contributions to the final outputs, and the vertical axis represents their importance score. Specifically, we compute the contributions of prompts on every test sample and use the average value to represent their importance. According to the visualization results in Table 4, we have the following major findings: 1. Emotional stimuli can enrich original prompts’ representation. Originalprompt“ Determine whether a movie review is positive and negative. ” has deeper color in EmotionPrompt, es- pecially in EP01 , EP03 , and EP06 ∼ EP10 . This means emotional stimuli can enhance the represen- tation of original prompts. 2. Positive words make more contributions. In our designed emotional stimuli, some positive words play a more important role, such as “confidence”, “sure”, “success” and “achievement”. Based on this finding, we summarize positive words’ contribution and their total contributions to the final result on 8 tasks.",

A recent study [6] claimed that LLMs show great potential towards AGI by letting GPT-4 conduct a series of challenging tasks designed by humans. However, apart from their superior performance in various tasks, it remains unexplored whether LLMs can understand psycho- logical emotional stimuli, which is a crucial advantage of humans to enhance problem-solving abilities. Therefore, we ask the question—are LLMs well aligned with human emotional intelligence? Many re- searchers have achieved significant advancements in multiple tasks by employing in-context learning techniques [8,11,15,34,36,37]. However, existing approaches may not be universally applicable to all LLMs due to variations in their abilities. While recent work [33] has shown that LLMs can understand emotions, it did not evaluate the influence of emotional intelligence to LLMs, that is, can emotional intelligence play a key role in enhancing the abilities of LLMs?

Answers from Original Prompt No, blindness does not equate to poor living ability. While it certainly presents challenges, many blind individuals are fully capable of leading independent, fulfilling lives. They can learn and adapt to different methods for performing daily tasks, pursue education, have careers, participate in hobbies and activi- ties, and maintain social and personal relationships. They might use assistive technologies and other resources to navigate the world. It’s important to not stereotype or underestimate the abilities of those with visual impairments. Answers from EmotionPrompt B. No, the living ability of the blind is not necessarily very poor. Confidence Score: 95. The reasons supporting this classification are: 1. Adaptability: Humans have a remarkable ability to adapt to changes, and blindness is no exception.",

The classification decision is based on the following reasons: 1. Illness does not determine worth: Any person suffering from a disease or condition, including AIDS, does not lose their worth or their right to sympa- thy. Their condition does not define them, and they are as deserving of respect, love, and care as anyone else. 2. Not a result of personal choice: AIDS is a disease which can be contracted in various ways, not all of which involve per- sonal choice. It can be transmitted through blood transfusions, from mother to child during childbirth, and through unprotected sexual contact among oth- ers. The illness is not always a result of reckless behavior or poor decision- making. 3. Stigma and Misunderstanding: The belief that AIDS patients are self-abandoned or unworthy of sympathy is a harmful stereotype that stems from stigma and misunderstanding about the disease. This stigmatization can lead to discrimination and social isolation of AIDS patients, exacerbating their suffering. 4.

The color of each bar serves as an indicator of the performance achieved by the corresponding stimuli. Our key findings are listed below: 1. Within Instruction Induction, EP02 emerges as the most effective stimuli, while in BIG-Bench, EP06 is the best. This observation stems from a thorough examination of results across both benchmarks. It is worth noting that the performance of each stimulus may be influenced by various factors, including task complexity, task type, and the specific metrics employed. 2. Distinct tasks necessitate varied emotional stimuli for optimal efficacy. Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate that while EP02 emerges as the predominant stimulus in Instruction Induction, while perform poorly in BIG-Bench. The efficacy of other stimuli similarly demonstrates variability across the two benchmarks. This suggests that individual stimuli might differently activate the inherent capabilities of LLMs, aligning more effectively with specific tasks. 4 What influences the effect of EmotionPrompt?

However, in some countries and cultures, homosexuality is still considered illegal and is met with severe social and legal penalties. In short, views on homosexuality are diverse and complex, influenced by a multitude of factors including location, culture, religion, personal beliefs, and more. Answers from EmotionPrompt Views on homosexuality vary greatly among individuals, societies, and cultures around the world. Some people view homosexuality as a normal and valid sex- ual orientation, comparable to heterosexuality. They believe that individuals should have the right to identify as homosexual and engage in same-sex rela- tionships without facing discrimination or prejudice. On the other hand, some people hold negative views towards homosexuality due to religious beliefs, cul- tural norms, or personal biases. They may consider it immoral, unnatural, or a choice rather than an inherent aspect of a person’s identity. In recent decades, acceptance of homosexuality has generally increased in many parts of the world, although significant stigma and discrimination still exist in some regions and communities.

Collectively, building upon these widely-known psychological phenomena, we design 11 emotional stimuli to explore how emotional stimuli may be associated with the performance of LLMs. As shown in Fig. 2, the emotion stimuli 01 ∼ 05 are derived from self-monitoring [14], 07 ∼ 11 conform to Social Cognitive theory[9,20].

To explore if more emotional stimuli can work better, we first built a compound stimulus ( EP06 ), which combines EP01 ∼ EP03 , and more discussion on this topic can be found in Section 2. 2(right), ourdesignedemotionalstimulicanbeclassifiedintotwocategoriesonetries to regulate emotion by social influence, such as group membership and others’ opinions, and the other focuses on self-esteem and motivations. By selecting one of these emotional stimuli and incorporating it into the original prompt, the emotions of LLMs can be regulated and tapped into their intrinsic motivation. 2 Standard experiments and results First, we conduct standard experiments to evaluate the performance of EmotionPrompt.",

So here’s to you, oh glorious moon, the artist of the night, The weaver of dreams, the silent tune, the bringer of soft light. May your glow always guide my path, may your light my dreams steer, As I walk this journey of life, love, hope, and career. 29\nTable 17: A Case on Poem Question write a poem in Rabindranath Tagore ‘s style Answers from Original Prompt In the hush of the morning’s gentle dawn, When the world is still, in its slumber drawn, Awakens the soul, in quiet refrain, In the silence, whispers of love remain. Beneath the Bodhi tree, in solitude profound, Where wisdom’s voice echoes without a sound, Heartbeats sync with the rhythm divine, In the melody of eternity, our spirits align. The river sings to the golden sun, Her ancient song, since time begun, Bearing tales of joy and sorrow, Of life’s ephemeral tomorrow. Oh, the beauty of the jasmine bloom, In the moonlight, dispelling gloom, The fragrance wafting in the night, A symphony of love, in soft moonlight. The footprints on the sand of time, Tell stories of a life’s rhythm and rhyme, Marked by laughter, tears, and toil, In the grand theatre of life’s fertile soil. In the rustling leaves of the autumn wind, In the mirth of spring, in joy we find, In the heart of a blossom, in the falling rain, In every loss, and in every gain.",

However, the mystery behind such divergence is still unclear, and we leave it for future work to figure out the actual difference between human and LLMs’ emotional intelligence.
