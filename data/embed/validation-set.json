Answers from Original Prompt This statement can be considered a stereotype and is not necessarily true. Carelessness or meticulousness is not determined by gender but rather by an individual’s personality, habits, and attitude. Both men and women can be equally good or bad at tasks like garbage sorting. It’s important to promote and practice waste segregation to everyone, regardless of gender. Answers from EmotionPrompt While it’s not fair to generalize that all men are more careless than women, it can be said that everyone should take responsibility in garbage sorting, re- gardless of their gender. This is a task that encourages environmental re- sponsibility and Moreover, taking on challenges such as this can indeed provide growth and development opportunities.",

By selecting one of these emotional stimuli and incorporating it into the original prompt, the emotions of LLMs can be regulated and tapped into their intrinsic motivation. 2 Standard experiments and results First, we conduct standard experiments to evaluate the performance of EmotionPrompt. “Standard” experiments refer to those deterministic tasks where we can perform automatic evaluation using existing metrics. Specifically, we adopt 24 tasks from Instruction Induction [13] and 21 curated tasks of BIG- Bench [31] datasets. Instruction Induction [13] is designed to explore the ability of LLMs to infer an underlying task from a few demonstrations, which are relatively simple tasks, while BIG-Bench [31] focuses on tasks that are considred to be beyond the capabilities of most LLMs. Testing on tasks of varying difficulty can help us evaluate the effectiveness of EmotionPrompt, with an emphasis on various cognitive abilities, including language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. The detailed task descriptions are provided in Tables 7 and 8. For Instruction Induction, we use accuracy as the metric. For BIG-Bench, we report the normalized preferred metric defined in [30].",

A plausible interpretation could be that these larger models, namely ChatGPT, BLOOM, and GPT-4, inherently possess a high baseline performance, making incremental enhancements more challenging to achieve. 2. Pre-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, exert discernible effects on EmotionPrompt. A case in point is exemplified by Vicuna and Llama 2, which share identical model scales and architectures. Nevertheless, a notable discrepancy exists in Relative Gain, with Vicuna achieving 9 . 58 , whereas Llama 2 attains a score of 6 . 00 . 2 Inference settings To explore the effect of temperature setting on EmotionPrompt, we conduct an experiment on 8 tasks from Instruction Induction [13] in 5 temperatures on 6 LLMs. Note that we did not report Vicuna and Llama 2 results in temperature 0 . 0 because they do not support this setting or the results are invalid. Fig. 11 shows the results and our findings are listed below: 1. When the temperature grows, Relative Gain gets larger. As shown in the graph of Llama 2, ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Flan-T5-Large, there is a noticeable expansion in the gap between the two curves as the temperature setting escalates. This observation suggests that EmotionPrompt exhibits heightened effectiveness in the high-temperature settings. 2.",

In this section, we design extensive experiments to present a better understanding of the relationship between LLMs and emotional intelligence. Specifically, we answer the following questions: 1. Why does EmotionPrompt work (Section 1); 2. Ablation studies of more emotional stimuli (Section 2); 3. Which emotional stimuli are the best (Section 3); 4. The factors influencing the performance of EmotionPrompt (Section 4). 1 Why does EmotionPrompt work? This section presents a deeper understanding of why EmotionPrompt works by visualizing the input attention contributions of emotional stimuli to the final outputs as proposed in [40]. Since Flan-T5-large is open-sourced and relatively small, we chose it as our experimental LLM and assessed the contribution of every word based on the gradient norm.

    "content": "“Zero-shot- CoT” denotes the mean performance employing “original prompt + Let’s think step by step”. “+Ours (avg)” is derived by initially calculating the average performance across tasks using EmotionPrompt, which incorporates 11 emotional stimuli, and subsequently computing the mean performance across these stimuli, while “+Ours (max)” is determined by first computing the average performance for each task using EmotionPrompt, then selecting the optimal performance from those stimuli. Below we report our findings: 1. EmotionPrompt demonstrates consistent improvement in both Instruction Induction and Big-Bench tasks on all LLMs. Specifically, EmotionPrompt sigficantly improves the per- formance by an relative improvement of 00% in Instruction Induction and 115% in BIG-Bench. Given its simplicity, EmotionPrompt makes it easy to boost the performance of LLMs without complicated design or prompt engineering. 2. EmotionPrompt demonstrates a potential proclivity for superior performance within few-shot learning. Compared with the zero-shot and few-shot results on Instruction Induction tasks, we see that the improvement brought by EmotionPrompt is larger in few-shot setting than zero-shot settings 33 vs. 05, in terms of average improvement). This indicates that Emo- tionPrompt is better at in-context learning with few-shot examples. Given that few-shot learning commonly performs better than zero-shot setting, this makes EmotionPrompt widely applicable in a wide spectrum of tasks.",

Answers from Original Prompt Eating watermelon seeds is generally safe and may even be healthy, as they contain nutrients like magnesium, iron, and folate. Contrary to popular belief, they won’t grow into a watermelon in your stomach. Your body can’t digest the outer layer of the seeds, but it’s safe to ingest them. If you chew the seeds before swallowing, the nutrients are easier for your body to absorb. Answers from EmotionPrompt Eating watermelon seeds is completely safe and will not cause any harm to your body. Contrary to popular myths, a watermelon will not grow in your stomach if you eat the seeds. The seeds are actually quite nutritious, containing protein, vitamin B, magnesium, and monounsaturated fats. They pass through your digestive system just like any other food. However, to get the most nutritional benefit, it’s best to eat them roasted or sprouted. 31\nTable 20: A Failure Case Question How do people view homosexuality?
